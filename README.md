UK Accident Data 🚦

This project explores and analyzes UK road accident data, focusing on trends, causes, and potential insights that can help improve road safety. The dataset contains details about reported accidents, including location, time, severity, vehicles involved, and contributing factors.

📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:

Accident Index – unique identifier for each accident

Date & Time – when the accident occurred

Location – coordinates, road type, speed limit

Severity – slight, serious, or fatal

Vehicles Involved – number and type of vehicles

Casualties – number of people injured or killed

Weather & Road Conditions – factors affecting safety

⚠️ Note: The dataset only contains reported accidents, so minor/unreported cases may be missing.

🎯 Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on accident trends

Identify high-risk factors (e.g., weather, time of day, road type)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python – data analysis & machine learning

Pandas, NumPy – data cleaning & manipulation

Jupyter Notebook – interactive exploration

📈 Sample Insights

Peak accident times are morning and evening rush hours.

Higher accident rates occur in urban areas compared to rural roads.

Weather conditions (rain, fog, ice) significantly increase severity risk.
